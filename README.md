# AFMLuminescence

## Goal

This software aim to reproduce the luminscence of a quantum dot (QD) layer. It does so by simulating a QD layer with electrons, and simulate their recombinations. The obtained spectra can be compared to one taken from an experiment, and the QD density can then be adjusted in order to extract the QD distribution from the luminescence.
